=== Background: Addressing the Medical Technology Gap for Developing Countries

Global health outreach programs have historically focused on infrastructure wide schemes to mature systems and capacity. Sponsors focus on either high-end research that pursues novel drugs and vaccines or expansive programs to mature the healthcare infrastructure (e.g., hospital and clinic construction). This has resulted ever-increasing gap in access to healthcare technologies for developing countries.

[[global_health_innovation_compasscomma_20]]
.Global Health Innovation Compass, _2009 Gomez-Marquez_
image::figs/web/01fig01.png[]

Appropriate technology often requires a nuanced approach to design that combines simple solutions, elegant technologies and robust engineering to make technologies survive the rigors of the field. This often produces a highly tailored approach to each solution that is difficult to standardize across sectors and across individuals.

We have taken steps to identify the most important tensions that exist in appropriate biomedical technologies seen through the design lens. By mapping RESOURCE INVESTMENT and IMPACT along a X-Y spectrum, we can anticipate how appropriate our solution is against conventional approaches. We call this the _Global Health Innovation Compass. ()_ It is a simple yet effective tool at guiding the design of a device to predict success in a developing world setting.


[[understanding_the_gap]]
==== Understanding the Gap

In the developing world, more than 95% of medical equipment in public hospitals is imported (Malkin 2007). In large part, these medical device imports were never designed with the developing world in mind. As a result, more than 80% of them fail within the first 6 months of deployment. In some cases, functioning equipment must be abandoned due to an inability to afford necessary consumables, such as clinical laboratory test strips, ECG electrodes, blood pressure transducers, and electrosurgery tips (Malkin 2007).

How did we get here? Why do appropriate medical technologies for resource poor settings lag behind mainstream social and developmental entrepreneurship initiatives such as environmentalism, agricultural technology, water sanitation, and energy? This gap in appropriate medical device development can be attributed to a variety of factors:


* The inherent risks of medical technology


* The slow pace of innovation and review in medicine that results from human safety regulations


* High costs of safety testing devices


* Lack of perceived shareholder return in developing country markets


* Hand-me-down technology transfer policies that disregard the long-term maintenance, environmental conditional and training required to sustain a device.


* The perception that regionally appropriate technology is inherently ‘low-tech’, alienating the brightest researchers in the field who favor sophisticated basic research aimed at rich healthcare settings.


* A lack of collaboration amongst developing world users and innovators and the conventional innovation pipeline structured in developed settings.

In response, a number of groups have structured programs to sustain these technologies via constant technology transfer of conventional devices (i.e., IMEC, Seeding Labs) and launch temporary trips to repaid and service equipment in bad shape (Engineering World Health, University of Michigan H.E.L.P., Engineers Without Borders). While these efforts are laudable, they are not sustainable beyond an NGOs goodwill, charity, and excess capacity of students. To really address this gap in medical technology, technologies that live in the upper left hand corner of that Global Health Innovation Compass are needed. Such devices follow the following set of design of parameters:

[[beyond_maintenance]]
==== Beyond Maintenance

As we look beyond maintenance and repair approaches to mitigate this problem, we find evidence of innovative solutions in the healthcare frontlines. Nurses are creating accessories for neonatal intensive care units, surgeons seeking homegrown suture and implant alternatives when Western implants become scarce, locally manufactured diagnostic tests and stethoscope repair from found parts—these solutions driven by necessity are a few of examples that catalyzed the launch of the MEDIKit project. Innovations in International Health at MIT (IIH) researchers working in Nicaragua, Ecuador and Peru recognized innovative design breakthroughs _can_ and _will happen_ indeveloping country settings. Working with the local medical user community as co-designers—not just as end clients—leads to inventive solutions that are more useful and sustainable to physicians and patients. _What these innovators and energetic potential designers lack are the facilities, tools, and device specific training to convert their ideas and improvisations into tools that will help patients._

[[introduction_to_medikits]]
=== Introduction to MEDIKits

MEDIKits (_M_ edical _E_ ducation _D_ esign _I_ nvention _K_ its) are DIY (_D_ o-_I_ t-_Y_ ourself) medical device kits designed to foster innovation and creativity in medical professionals within developing countries. In the same way that a set of Lego blocks can come together to form a child’s toy, MIT created a series of building blocks and lessons that converge into medical device prototypes. The MEDIKIT kits are a major initiative of MIT’s Innovations in International Health program (IIH) and are backed by a grant from the Inter-American Development Bank. By demystifying the technology of medical devices and providing a collection of appropriate tools and materials, MEDIKit enables medical professionals to develop their own medical device solutions using locally available resources. MEDIKit prototyping enables appropriate medical devices strategies that focus on distributed point of care solutions without waiting for large healthcare infrastructure investments.

A typical user of the MEDIKit is a healthcare professional that has been identified as a lead user, whose ideas could be transformed by converting them from drawings and verbal descriptions into tangible medical device prototypes. Our work has shown that user and designers have a more meaningful experience by interacting with their prototyped ideas that just explaining abstract concepts.

In accordance to our proposed scope of work, MIT’s Innovations in International Health has developed the following kits.


* Paper strip diagnostics: Using low cost reagents and testing strips coupled to mobile phone systems.


* Prosthetics: Using locally manufactured parts and designs from the Open Prosthetics Project to create low cost prosthetic and rehabilitation aids.


* Medical Instruments and Surgical equipment: Designing new types of appropriate and low-cost medical instrument and surgical devices for use in extreme environments.


* Drug delivery: Including methods and devices for drug delivery such as inhalable agents, time-release capsules, and topical solutions

Low-cost Lab on a Chip diagnostics: Using a low cost template to produce custom lab on a chip diagnostics based on locally available reagents and chemicals to improve access to diagnostics.


[[kit_methodology]]
==== Kit Methodology

MIT’s IIH has been working with advanced prototyping kits with a 6 sets of undergraduate classes in Cambridge, as well as experience in deploying these kits in Central and South America. When designing the kits for medical device design the following performance parameters were sought:


* _Modular construction_ that would enable reproduction of prototypes amongst the user collective


* Coded components that create the grammar for a _Language of Design_ to enable collaboration


* Emphasis on _locally available parts_ and a reliable supply chain of imported ones. We did not get idealistic on this point. There are some components that will inevitably have to be imported (e.g., Arduinos), but they are not so rare in the United States that it might hamper the performance of each kit.


* An understanding that the continuum between _Direct Instruction_ and _Do-It-Yourself_ (DIY) will have to be biased towards a DIY methodology after an initial ramp up of Direct Instruction by MIT.


* Two phases in each kit: _Modular start-up_ parts that easily come together, and a more _abstract systems_ that can provide the medical device inventor in the making the degrees of design freedom they seek.


* A _focus on invention_ rather than maintenance. Our initial assessment of the technical dexterity of our target population shows a high perceived correlation between maintenance activities and technical activities. It is our purpose to promote new technologies not sustain failing ones.


[[medikit_course_development]]
==== MEDIKit Course Development

The MEDIKit project started in Nicaragua during the summer of 2009 with intensive recruiting efforts in partnership with CIES (Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios de Salud, de la UNAN) and CARE. To determine the appropriate audience for the training, we ran pre-pilot workshops in Managua, with a group of 20 pharmacy students, and in Estelí with 25 nurses and nursing students. Following these workshops, we continued to work with CIES on the institutional certification requirements and processes, which include 40 hours of classroom work and an additional 100 hours of work for students outside of the classroom. Recruiting continued through 2010, hosting pre-pilot trainings in Managua, Ocotal, Jinotepe, Masaya, Leon and Granada. After interacting with the breadth of different demographics across the country, we determined the identification of training staff for the MEDIKit course would be focused specifically in rural areas such as Jinotepe and Ocotal. These areas demonstrate the largest disparities in quality of health care available and are full of medical professionals and technicians eager to learn about and create technology solutions.

Intense training was done during January and February 2011 on both the use of the kits, their implementation and strategies for replication. Through an application process, training was administered to 17 students in Jinotepe and 8 students Ocotal (25 in total).

[[medikit_classroom_in_jinotepe]]
.MEDIKit Classroom in Jinotepe
image::figs/web/01fig02a.png[]

Each training site was equipped with a set of MEDIKits which students had access to during and outside of the course. In addition, classroom sites were chosen based on internet access. Each training location has a virtual room where students have access to computers for long-distance communication with the IIH team in Boston. In the end of the training period, kits were left in both Jinotepe and Ocotal for students to access. Based on the quality of initial prototypes and dedication to the MEDIKit course mission, we identified the most promising lead-users of the technology within the group of students in Ocotal. As a result, additional resources were dedicated to equipping an H-Lab/MEDIKit prototyping space within the Nursing School in Ocotal with the support of CIES and the Regional Ministry of Health.

Of the 25 students trained in the use of the MEDIKits, four have been selected by the MIT team and CIES to be brought in as certified MEDIKit faculty at CIES to teach future MEDIKit classes in the impoverished department of Neuva Segovia in the following municipalities: Ocotal, Dipilto, Monzonte, Ciudad Antigua, El Jícaro, Jalapa, Macuelizo, Murra, Quilalí, San Fernando, Santa María and Wiwili de Nueva Segovia. With the materials and available laboratory space, each of the four trainers will be able to reach 25 people with a total anticipated impact of 100 MEDIKit trainees within the next year. The MEDIKit faculty will train health professionals in one of the most impoverished regions in the country. Nueva Segovia has a population of 235,000, almost 80% of the population lives in severe to high poverty, with access to only one departmental hospital. The rest of the health care services are provided through municipal health centers or first line of care, rural health posts, where almost 79% of the population is served. This group of trainers includes the head doctor for continuing education in the Regional Ministry of Health, the lead psychologist from the Regional Ministry of Health in Ocotal and two laboratory technicians from the Regional laboratory in Ocotal.

[[drug_delivery_systems]]
==== Drug Delivery Systems

Drug delivery systems were an immediate launching point for impact opportunities. Among the lessons, students learned the basics of nebulizer design, autodestructible syringe systems and monitor and control systems for IV infusion therapy. As illustrative examples, students designed a low cost nebulizer that does not require electricity and then built upon their design to serve multiple patients at once (&lt;&lt;nurses_and_doctor_during_a_successful_te&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;exploring_the_drug_deliver_kit_for_parts&gt;&gt;).

[[nurses_and_doctor_during_a_successful_te]]
.Nurses and Doctor during a successful test of the foot-powered nebulizer
image::figs/web/01fig03a.png[]

In a very interactive exercise, students created an IV alarm system using kit components such as toy circuits from local markets. When the bag reached a minimum level, the alarm sounded to alert the nurse. Teaching students to repurpose found mechanisms in toys and even in un-repairable medical devices empowers them to design their appropriate equipment.


[[diagnostic_lateral_flow_devices]]
==== Diagnostic Lateral Flow Devices

The identification of conditions through the use of existing rent via novel techniques was the focus of the diagnostics kit. Lessons plans focused on the main architecture of lateral flow assays---rapid tests---and technologies that can extend their capacity.

[[exploring_the_drug_deliver_kit_for_parts]]
.Exploring the Drug Deliver Kit for parts to create a nebulizer
image::figs/web/01fig04a.png[]

We designed custom PuzzleDx components to easily create chemical combinations. Students learned how to create custom chemical diagnostics such as combination protein, glucose, and kretone tests to characterize renal function in diabetic patients. In total, the PuzzleDx components can be combined to form 16 different individual tests and an array of combinations among them.

In addition, students explored alternative methods of sample preparation by designing and building a bicycle-powered centrifuge. Students also learned to use automatic deposition technologies included in the kit: Ink jet deposition by modifying affordable office jet printers; multiplexed paper channel creation as shown in &lt;&lt;multiplex_diagnostics_manufactured_using&gt;&gt;.

In line with our theme of Core plus Extendable Technologies for each kit students were able to extend the core functionality of their diagnostics for enhanced interpretation and telemedicine. Examples include using paper microfluidics to modify diagnostics into easier to understand test panels. In addition, through the use of digital microscopy and cell phones, they learned mechanisms for image analysis and telemetry.

[[microfluidics]]
==== Microfluidics

As described in earlier midterm reports, the microfluidics kit cossets of a series of physical and virtual systems for creating modular lab-on-chip devices. Students learned Xurographic microfluidics using automatic computer controlled cutters to fabricate precise devices (&lt;&lt;filling_microfluidic_chips_with_samples&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;close-up_of_microfluidic_chip&gt;&gt;).

[[filling_microfluidic_chips_with_samples]]

[[close-up_of_microfluidic_chip]]

image::figs/web/01fig09a.png[]

Again, through the use of digital microscopy, students were able to analyze microfluidic reactions and generate many tests on a single credit card sized device that can be manufactured locally (&lt;&lt;examining_samples_on_the_microfluidic_ch&gt;&gt;). Armed with these tools, students, particularly those with conventional laboratory backgrounds are working on adapting their assays to take advantage of Microfluidic features: integrated design, reduction in the use of reagents and samples, potential for on-board optical characterization of cells.

[[examining_samples_on_the_microfluidic_ch]]
.Examining samples on the microfluidic chips
image::figs/web/01fig10.png[]


[[prosthetics]]
==== Prosthetics

Nicaragua has several well-established and affordable prosthetics centers. Thefocus of our prosthetic MEDIKits were functional prosthetics which we callagricultural prosthetics. Students learned to assemble a universal adapter to fit upper limb prosthesis. The adapter was coupled to a universal pneumatic gripper made using modified bicycle inner tubes. (&lt;&lt;assembling_modular_agricultural_prosthet&gt;&gt;) The gripper connects to an array of farming and manual labor attachment: fruit pickets, rakes, cutters, etc. (&lt;&lt;testing_the_fruit-picker_prosthetic&gt;&gt;). The impact of the design is powerful because it provides amputees with an equalizing set of tools for their work activities. Students learned how to assemble the devices in less than 10 minutes, providing a portable and locally manufacturable solution.

image::figs/web/01fig12.png[]


[[vital_signs]]
==== Vital Signs

The Vital Signs MEDIKits lend to an understanding of the _fundamental_ 3 block architecture of vital signs systems: Sensor, Microprocessor, Modulation and the _extendable_ architecture of peripherals that couple to these systems: Telemetry, Data Logging, Re-interpretation. Students were able to take a variety of devices and create systems that extend access to health care by coupling them to radio transmitters, recorders, and Internet-connected devices. Furthermore, they were able to enhance the reading capacity of an EKG by replacing the sensorial electrodes and adapt their locally available materials. Using information from the OpenECG project, they were able to understand the processes behind local manufacture of electrodes from available items instead of expensive imported devices.

Additional exercises involved the use of portable doppler based fetal monitors for antenatal care. By exploring the internal circuitry students were able to determine the 3-block architecture and provide suggestions for extendable features. We anticipate that the extendable design ideas for the fundamental architecture of the devices to be a major platform for collaboration in the next few months with MIT researchers and students.

In addition to the fabrication of prototypes through the technology kits, lesson plans included appropriate guidelines for patient use of technologies. We anticipate that some devices will reach patient-care more quickly than others due to regulatory approval processes among other factors. Through our work with CIES, we have gained an understanding of the local regulatory process for conducting clinical trials on medical devices and included this knowledge as part of the MEDIKit training curriculum. This knowledge will be instrumental as we continue to work with graduates from the MEDIKit course as technology advisors. Our understanding of the regulatory requirements and CIES’ ability to navigate the local regulatory system will accelerate the introduction of technologies invented through MEDIKits (See &lt;&lt;process_for_clinical_trials_for_medical&gt;&gt;). As students from the MEDIKit project begin to invent new or modified technologies we plan to work with CIES to document case-study examples of this process.

[[process_for_clinical_trials_for_medical]]
.Process for Clinical Trials for Medical Devices in Nicaragua
image::figs/web/01fig03.png[]


[[development_of_research_base_and_center]]
=== Development of Research Base and Center of Excellence

The MEDIKit training initiative has added to the development of anIIH MIT H-Lab site in Nicaragua. In 2007, CIES and MIT began a fruitful collaboration on a specific project called XoutTB — a system for tuberculosis therapy adherence. More information can be found in Appendix I. Since then, we sought to establish a permanent research base in Nicaragua in collaboration with CIES and a friendly relationship with CARE. The relationship has been dubbed H-Lab. Activities at the H-Lab Research Base and Center of Excellence include engineering field trials for medical devices and medical technology training for public health researchers. The H-Lab site accelerates the development of medical technologies, bridging the “lab to field” gap that is common among academic laboratories. The H-Lab site enables more fluidcollaboration between local researchers and medical professionals and MIT engineers. Additionally, we are able to leverage CIES facilities in Managua set up prototyping labs, host conferences and training workshops. In addition, CIES has a satellite campus in Ocotal, one of the locations for the MEDIKit training. Through this collaborative relationship, we upgraded CIES’ access to medical technologies. The IIH model, even in Boston, works by sharing existing resources (physical, human, etc) amongst collaborators to create something larger than the sum of its parts. We extended that approach to the H-Lab model in Nicaragua. A network is too flimsy, and it largely descends into a glorified online message-board/mailing list or an annual conference. What we have in the H-Lab model is affiliating or federalizing different facilities as part of a cohesive research infrastructure. That said, the MEDIK deployment, particularly in Ocotal, was accentuated by CIES reserving some lab space in the School of Nursing where we have dedicated prototyping and experimental space.

An H-Lab is a Center of Excellence and a permanent member of the IIH collaborative where researchers develop technologies, test devices, launch clinical trials, and have priority access to solutions coming out of IIH labs. The MEDIK project is the culmination of that effort. The H-Lab presence is inclusive of both CIES facilities in Managua, Ministry of Health clinics in Jinotepe, Esteli, and Ocotal, and a CIES-managed facility in Ocotal in collaboration with the school of nursing. Within the scope of the MEDIKit project, IADB suggested Activity 3.3 as a mechanism to ensure that we deployed and developed technology that would receive local uptake.1 This is very much in line our philosophy and our operational model. In the fall of 2008, a series of on site visits allowed us to determine fundamental needs of CIES to be effective as a research partner. Our primary aim was to characterize it as either a clinical trial site or a development site. Given our interest in nurturing homegrown innovation and our early findings of such activities, we sought to make CIES a development site. MEDIKits defined our approach. Traditionally, one would raise enough funding to construct a traditional laboratory. Given that this was not available and difficult to scale, we produced MEDIKits that could be deployed with or without typical laboratory infrastructure.

The next steps would be to determine what type of kits would be deployed. We identified the technology themes for the MEDIKits through a series of six trips to Nicaragua between March 2009 and October 2010. The diagnostic tools used for the includeda survey assessment tool administered by IIH Researchers and MIT students and anecdotal interviews conducted by IIH Researchers (the survey assessment tool used can be found in Appendix 2). The survey tool document technology design challenges from 15 representative health care facilities across the country. These survey results, along with input from Nicaraguan medical professionals, guided our decision to frame the MEDIKit technologies around the themes of: Diagnostics, Microfluidics, Drug Delivery, Vital Signs and Prosthetics. The diagram below illustrates the logical framework for determining these technology themes to address at the H-Lab Research Base.

[[determination_of_kit_themes]]
.Determination of kit themes
image::figs/web/01fig04.png[]

Deploying the MEDIKit technologies in Nicaragua has empowered a group of medical professionals and scientists to collaborate with researchers in Boston. The MEDIKits create a common language of design that allows users to share their ideas more rapidly and it also introduces users to an area of technology that they never knew existed. After working closely local scientists and health professionals in Nicaragua for the MEDIKit project, we have identified tangible research opportunities for future collaborations with our lab:


* _Adherence monitoring of Tuberculosis and HIV patients:_Professors at CIES have expressed interest in using rapid result paper diagnostic platforms from the MEDIKit project to monitor the adherence of patients in the Northern Atlantic Autonomous Region of Nicaragua, where access to laboratory analysis equipment is scarce.


* _Telemedicine and Digital Microscopy:_Two laboratory technicians from the MEDIKit cohort in Ocotal have expressed interest in designing formal research projects using three different types microscopes from the MEDIK Diagnostic Reader kit.

In addition to engaging CIES in the MEDIKit project, we have also connected with the UNAN School of Medicine to host a Biomedical Technology Seminar series, by inviting IIH researchers from Boston to present their work to the medical community in Managua, Nicaragua. These seminars were supported by a student technology group within the School of Medicine UNAN:


* November 2010, Dr. Catherine Klapperich’s work on remote sample collection of DNA was presented to a group of professors and medical students.


* January 2011, Dr. David Wood from Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology presented on his work in microfluidic systems used for rapidly testing DNA damage.

To connect researchers and students from these seminars with the MEDIKit students in Jinotepe and Ocotal, we have created a member-based online platform, link:$$http://hlabmanagua.ning.com$$[], where researchers and practioners are able to share ideas via blog entries, real-time chat, forums and uploaded photos and videos.


[[med_id00016a]]
image::figs/web/01fig05a.png[]

As an IIH H-Lab site in Nicaragua, the Hospital Alfonso MoncadaGuillén and Regional Laboratory of Ocotal have been equipped with internet access, allowing graduates from the MEDIKit course to freely communicate via email, Skype and Ning with each other and the IIH team in Boston whenever an idea strikes.

We proud of the social network website we have implemented. Its main function is to create a platform for collaboration among participants and use the multimedia capabilities found in most on-line professional networking tools.

We have learned some lessons about its future use. The website—in fact, any website—requires overcoming a certain “activation energy” or inertia for participants to use it. Our experience in Latin America has been that the digital divide is not as critical as the lack of a culture of digital access. We do not yet have an answer to address sustained usage of the Internet in countries like Nicaragua. Day to day business activities are still conducted face to face or by telephone calls. The scope of this contract does not include address this larger concern but MIT feels compelled to underscore the importance of the issue. The Internet, unlike electrification, has not been a “build it and they will come” technological solution. Upon its arrival, there needs to be sustained training and outreach programs to incent people to capture the information potential of the tool. One only needs to measure the time it takes to get a typical email answered from a healthcare worker in a rural area despite widespread access to Internet via Cybercafes. Those same cafes are not filled with individuals seeking information but rather teenagers playing games or engaged in entertainment behavior. The majority of the adults are using the Internet connections to make phone calls.

The H-Lab site has resulted in a collaboration model espoused by IIH to propel new technologies via resource and talent sharing. The &lt;&lt;collaboration_between_cies_and_mit_to_cr&gt;&gt; illustrates the collaborative aspect of the relationship and &lt;&lt;results_of_h-lab_site_in_nicaragua&gt;&gt; presents some of the results from this collaboration.

[[collaboration_with_mitapostrophes_d-lab]]
=== Collaboration with MIT’s D-Lab

During March 2009 and again in March 2010, MIT D-Lab students have traveled to Ocotal, Nicaragua to work with the local doctors and nurses on identifying challenges in equipment and patient care and developing appropriate solutions. Resulting projects from these trips include a colormetric glucometer and a sensor system for measuring nebulizer dosage.

Already this year, the group of certified MEDIKit students in Ocotal and Jinotepehave access to D-Lab Health students for design reviews of prototypes. In March 2011, the MEDIKit students in Ocotal and Jinotepe will host a group of 12 MIT students for a week of brainstorming and prototyping technology solutions to specific challenges in the local hospitals and clinics. Following this visit to Jinotepe and Ocotal, MIT D-Lab students will be designing prototypes in Cambridge with remote collaboration from MEDIKit students to address challenges identified in hospitals and clinics in Nicaragua. The design parameters for these prototypes include a common language of design that is easily transferable to the MEDIKit students in Nicaragua. For example, color-coded nebulizers the mechanisms of each part and where they should be connected (&lt;&lt;design_review_between_medikit_students_i&gt;&gt;).

[[design_review_between_medikit_students_i]]
.Design review between MEDIKit students in Nicaragua and MIT D-Lab students in Cambridge
image::figs/web/01fig13.png[]

Additionally, MIT’s D-Lab offers support for a select number of MEDIKit students and research affiliates from Nicaragua to spend up to a month at the MIT campus in Cambridgeas a designer-in-residence, collaborating with MIT faculty and students on pursuing their next great invention to bridge the gap in health care in Nicaragua.


[[next_steps_with_medikit_development]]
=== Next steps with MEDIKit Development

We believe that the MEDIKit holds the potential to close the access gap of medical technologies in developing countries. MEDIK can empower local innovators to produce their own devices, rise to the level of collaborators, and create novel solutions. We are extremely proud of this project and consider it one of our flagship activities. Research and development towards refining the kits continues in our labs and we will continue to share those efforts with our Nicaraguan collaborators.

MIT has a long history of spinning off tools for design, invention and research from its labs. Lego Mindstorm kits, affordable 3-D printers, and accessible software development languages such as Scratch and ModKit have all spun out as commercial entities with a strong social mission. As an early assessment, we offer the next critical steps to scale up the project:


[[manufacture]]
==== Manufacture

_Identify those components_ that:


* Are locally available (e.g., syringes)


* Locally manufacturable (e.g., masks)


* Easily available via importation (e.g., foot pumps)


* Need to be custom manufactured (e.g., microfluidic molds for local manufacture of microfluidic parts)

Work with the principal investigator to _support an entity that serves a kit assembler_.

_Determine in-country assembly versus turn-key availability_. Bear in mind that certain core parts can be imported but consumables will be designed to be found locally, even from sources that are free or recycled. This is the case with the reagents for the microfluidics kit, for instance.


[[policy]]
==== Policy

_Create influential educational policies_ that focus on inventive prototyping in medicine, particularly amongst the lower ranking professional classes (e.g., nurses, lab technicians) who are more predisposed to manually solve their solution instead of lobbying their budgetary authority around a problem.

In conjunction with the Schools of Medicine, Engineering, and Vocational Institutes, _find local champions that_ share the self-empowerment philosophy of the kits.

_Create a mandateso that healthcare education can include the consideration of medical equipment innovation_, not just medical equipment maintenance. This is very fine line that needs to be delineated. As stated earlier, maintenance activities sustain unsuitable technologies. Medical device innovation creates technologies that rise above the infrastructure drawbacks to solve problems such as the foot powered nebulizer solution assembled with the Drug Delivery Kit.


[[cultural_considerations]]
==== Cultural considerations

We have learned a lot about medical culture in Central and South America. Hierarchies between doctors and nurses need to be flattened. _Incentives towards rural medicine need to be strengthened_ so those locations stop being “hardship posts”. One way we are doing this is by using our technologies as a healthcare pull towards those doctors in the city who want to collaborate with scientists from MIT. By placing our projects purposely in the outskirts, we pull these doctors towards where they, and our technologies, are needed the most. The cultural gap between doctors, nurses and technicians is a long-term concern that may be addressed by local champions who provide the appropriate collaborative behavior to serve as an example.


[[expansion_and_sustainability]]
=== Expansion and Sustainability

We receive calls from Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, India and parts of Africa yearning to learn more about to how expand the reach of the kits and create additional H-Lab sites. Piloting our kits in Nicaragua, a country with “predictable political instability” that is buffered by strong local partners has prepared us to create a responsive deployment plan. We would welcome additional expansion opportunities to other countries in Central and South America. After one more round of R&amp;D refinement, we feel that the best way is though a commercial entity. The MEDIKits themselves can be sold as a product to universities, Ministries of Health and NGOs in the same way medical equipment and computers are currently financed to these entities in developing countries. While the original model of MEDIKit was based on a training program run by IIH Researchers, an expansion model would include the ability for selected MEDIKit graduates to teach the training as certified CIES instructors.

As we continue to develop the technologies we strive to reach adaptable and intuitive technology designs that rely less and less on the training program and more on the motivation of local users to invent. Supplementing the MEDIKit training with the creation of the H-Lab Center of Excellence in Nicaragua was a strength of our program. We are able to leverage the collaborations with CIES and CARE to engage policy makers in the Ministry of Health on the significance of local innovation in medical technology.

Based on our findings from this project, MEDIKits can be sold on two tiers:


. MEDIKit Series (5 Kits)


. MEDIKit Series + Development of H-Lab Center of Excellence

In the first option, a series of 5 MEDIKits can be purchased directly. This would include a 2-week train the trainers program for local staff to be trained in MEDIKit methodology. The second option is much more inclusive, including a 6-12 month contract with IIH researchers to develop an H-Lab Center of Excellence at the site where the kits will be distributed. MEDIKits are designed to stand-alone technology kit to enable innovation at the frontline of healthcare in developing countries. However, when distributed within an H-Lab Center of Excellence ecosystem, such as Managua, Nicaragua, the network ensures that the users will not innovate in a vacuum and that there will be resources to validate the inventions from the kits.

Naturally, the point is to ensure access. A successful continued deployment would produce a minimum metric of kit accessibility to traditional deprived healthcare regions. A failure mode would be to produce a MEDIKit program that would only be accessible to elite private medical institutions serving the richest patients. Our focus, our mandate and our drive are to close the gap of medical access for poor patients. For that we need sustained support and funding via commercial structure. We will continue to enjoy the backing from MIT and we hope the same from the Inter-American Development Bank. Thanks to the Bank, the project has been highlighted as one of the flagship initiatives at the Innovations in International Health Lab at MIT. It is being exhibited by the Smithsonian’s National Design Museum and illustrated as model for inclusive scientific capacity building. We are proud of the recognition, but at the end of the day we seek to empower the recognition of those innovators in the field, because they are the ones that deserve the our utmost attention and our long term support.
